# Stored Ether Project

```markdown

## Description
This project showcases a straightforward Solidity contract featuring 2-3 functions, along with a user-friendly frontend application built using React.js. The contract enables the configuration and retrieval of values, which are then showcased in the frontend user interface.

## Getting Started

### Installing

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.

```shell
npm install
```

### Executing Program
Launch the React development server by running the following command:

Open your preferred web browser and access http://localhost:3000 to interact with the application.

## Usage
The application's interface exhibits the current values associated with the contract's functions.
